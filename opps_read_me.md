## ğŸ§  Concepts Covered

### ğŸ”¹ 1. `Abstraction.java`
- Demonstrates abstract classes and methods
- Shows how to hide implementation details and show only functionality

### ğŸ”¹ 2. `Encapsulation.java`
- Example of private fields with public getters/setters
- Protects internal object state and maintains data integrity

### ğŸ”¹ 3. `Inheritance.java` & `InheritenceOfIngerit.java`
- Shows single and multilevel inheritance
- Demonstrates code reuse and method overriding

### ğŸ”¹ 4. `polymorphism.java`
- Demonstrates method overloading and overriding
- Core to run-time and compile-time polymorphism

### ğŸ”¹ 5. `Aggregation.java`
- Shows "Has-A" relationships between classes (composition-like structure)

### ğŸ”¹ 6. `super_keyword.java` & `inherited_super_this_final.java`
- Use of `super()` to refer to parent class members and constructors
- Understanding of method chaining, constructor order, and `final` usage

### ğŸ”¹ 7. `this.java`
- Shows use of `this` keyword to refer to current class instance and avoid variable shadowing

### ğŸ”¹ 8. `upcasting.java`
- Explains how parent reference can point to child object
- Used in dynamic dispatch and polymorphism

### ğŸ”¹ 9. `shadowing_problem.java`
- Explains variable shadowing when same name exists in parent and child
